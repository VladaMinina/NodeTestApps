How Works CLUSTER ?????
Initial Request:
When a request comes to http://localhost:3322, it hits the load balancer running in the primary process.

Load Balancer:
The load balancer determines which worker to send the request to (this logic needs adjustment, as previously mentioned).
It creates an internal HTTP request to the selected workerâ€™s port.

Worker Processes:
The request is received by the appropriate worker (e.g., http://localhost:3323).
Each worker processes the request using the router and sends back the response.

Response Flow:
The response from the worker is piped back through the load balancer to the original requester.
